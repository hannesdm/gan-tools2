# Training of Generative Adversarial networks
This repository contains the boilerplate Tensorflow 2 code necessary to train Generative Adversarial Networks in the standard, non-saturating, setting and in the Wasserstein setting.
Under the 'impl' folder, examples can be found on how to use this framework.
